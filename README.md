## Why?
The world is not perfect.  
We have all worked somewhere we _didn't **love**_. <br />
We have _all_ felt the _frustration_ of using products that have flaws
that _we_ were unable to fix ourselves.   
We have all experienced being in an environment that
_didn't support us_ in doing all we can do in the world.
**The aim of _dwyl_ is to address *all* of these issues _simultaneously_:**
please read our [**mission**](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/mission.md#what-is-dwyls-mission)
to understand our focus on personal effectiveness
as the starting point for all positive change.

If you'd like to know more about what we value,
_please **read our [manifesto](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md)**_.  
 The short version is:
"_**Treat others as you would like others to treat you**_" ~
[***The Golden Rule***](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md)

we *highly recommend* taking a few minutes to watch his **Ted Talk**:
